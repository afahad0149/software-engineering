# The polyglot

Today you’ll become familiar with 3 new programming languages: Ruby, Python, and C.

Learning other programming languages is fun, and the more languages you learn, the easier it gets to learn new ones. It’s even easier than with human languages, since programming languages are more similar to each other.

Every section of this exercise is composed of a tutorial and some practice. It’s a good idea to go through the tutorial individually, and then sync with your pair to do the coding part together.

Before starting, check how many hours you have available in total for this exercise. Then divide them in 3 equal sections, one for each language, and set timers making sure you switch to the new section when the time comes.

### Ruby

Complete the [Learn Ruby](https://www.learnrubyonline.org/) tutorial.

Once you’re done, solve the [Highest Word Count](https://github.com/codeworks/tp-highest-word-count) problem using Ruby.

### Python

Read the [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/) tutorial.

Ok, now solve the [Evented Thing](https://github.com/codeworks/tp-evented-thing) problem using Python.

### C

Finally go through the [Learn C](https://www.learn-c.org/) tutorial.

Now implement a “[shuffle](http://underscorejs.org/#shuffle)” function in C.

## Getting started

- Install Ruby (on Mac use `brew install ruby`, on Windows use [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/), on Linux use your system’s package manager).
- Install Python (on Mac use `brew install python`, on Windows use the [latest stable release](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), on Linux use your system's package manager).
- Install a C compiler (on Mac use `brew install gcc`, on Windows [follow the instructions here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compile-a-c-program-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-160), on Linux use your system’s package manager).
- Open your code editor and start working on the files in the `/code` folder of this repo.

## Extra credits

- Can you figure out how to write unit tests for your code in each language?
- Try out the [Arduino simulator on Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/project-gallery;collectionId=OMOZACHJ9IR8LRE). Start by looking at the examples there to understand how it works and get some ideas (you’ll need to create an account). Then think of a nice device you want to build, and program it using C.
