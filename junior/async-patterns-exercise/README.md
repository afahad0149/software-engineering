# Async patterns

Time to practice your asynchronous skills in JavaScript!

This exercise is designed to make you understand the 3 core patterns used in JS to do asynchronous programming:

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/await

Your objective is to make all the test pass, without modifying them.

## Getting started

- Take a quick look at the official docs for [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and [async / await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) (max 10 mins, no need to dive deep, just enough to get an idea). You can always come back to it later throughout the exercise, or at the end for a recap.
- Install the required dependencies using `npm i`.
- Open `index.js` and complete the requirements there.
