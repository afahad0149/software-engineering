## Data structures

Outline the characteristics of the following data structures.

### Queue

A queue is a list that all insertions are done in the tail and removals in the head (also called dequeue).

### Stack

### Tree

Tree are non-linear data structures that each nodes contain childrens. Each child is a tree itself. 

### Hash table

In a hash table each element of the array has an index which allows accessing data very fast.


### Binary search tree

Are trees that children have maximum two nodes and data is stored in order from left to right.


## Complexity analysis


### Explain the difference between constant and linear complexity.

In algorithms constant complexity is when time and space cost don't increase when increase the number of operation. I.e. accessing to data in an array by an index. While linear complexity is when time and space cost increase linearly as operations increase. I.e. iterating an array.
