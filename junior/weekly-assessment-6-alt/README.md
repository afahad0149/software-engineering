# Weekly assessment 6 - Alternative (4 hours)

This is your final weekly assessment, it sums up many concepts youâ€™ve learned in the junior part of the course, and it marks your passage to the senior part.

You have to create a full-stack app to post and list books.

Make sure to:

- Use proper indentation.
- Comment your code where needed.
- Lint your code before committing.
- Commit often and follow the [Semantic Commit Message](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages) convention.

## Front End

Start by creating the Front End, in the meantime you can use this [Apiary documentation](https://favbooks.docs.apiary.io/).

- Use the React CLI to set-up the client folder, running `create-react-app client`.
- Your app should allow users to do the following:
  - View a list of your list of books sorted for author's surnames.
  - Render the favourites books before in the list with the favourites icon.
  - Add a new book. When a new book is added, the book list should reflect the changes automatically and the form fields should be cleaned.
  - When styling your application, you *must* use vanilla CSS.

## Back End

Replace the provided Apiary with your own implementation.

Create a `/server` folder and implement an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) REST server connected to a MongoDB database with [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/). It should offer the following API methods:

- `POST /books` - Creates a new record in the database with the following parameters:

  - `title`: *String*. The title of the book.
  - `author_name`: *String.* The name of the book author.
  - `author_surname`: *Sting.* The surname of the book author.
  - `favourite`: *Bool*. If its in your favourite list.

  All these parameters are mandatory. The server should return a `201` status code for success, and a `400` HTTP status code in case any parameter is missing.

- `GET /books - Returns a list of all books stored in the database, in JSON format. 

  ```json
  [
    {
        "_id": "234tyghu01",
        "title": "Eloquent JavaScript",
        "author_name": "Marijn",
        "author_surname": "Haverbeke",
        "favorite": true
    }, {
        "_id": "4566iyguh",
        "title": "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
        "author_name": "Douglas",
        "author_surname": "Crockford",
        "favorite": false
    }
  ]
  ```

## Extra credits

- Manage the global state with `React.Context`
- Show a loader (e.g. spinner) when fetching the event list.
- Create an `ApiClient` service as a JavaScript Module that shares the logic for calling `fetch` and abstracts it behind methods (i.e.: `apiClient.getBooks()`).
