# Legacy project proposal

You’ve figured out how to build a whole app by yourself, but working on someone else’s code is a whole new challenge as you’ll soon discover.

Besides this, it’s time to start making apps that are more reliable and secure through the implementation of automated testing.

## Getting started

To send your project proposal:

1. Choose a classmate to pair up with (sit next to each other if you’re in the same campus, or connect through a video call if you’re working remotely).
2. Together choose a solo project, from other classmates, that you’d like to take on. This needs to be a project that none of you has worked on yet.
3. One of you should fork this repo (it doesn’t matter who).
4. Edit the `proposal.md` file, adding the required data.
5. Commit your changes.
6. Send a pull request.

We will review your proposal and give you feedback before the project starts, to make sure it’s aligned with the course learning goals.
